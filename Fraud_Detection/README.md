# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions. This project explores both supervised and unsupervised approaches for fraud detection, aiming to highlight anomaly detection skills and handle unlabeled data effectively.

## Dataset
We used the  Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.

## Steps Breakdown
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
    - Analyzed and prepared the data, including handling class imbalance with SMOTE and scaling numerical features.
2. **Supervised Model Development**
    - Built a baseline Logistic Regression model and an optimized XGBoost model, with evaluation based on accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score.
3. **Unsupervised Model Development**
    - Implemented an Isolation Forest anomaly detection model to identify outliers.
4. **Model Evaluation**
    - Evaluated models using ROC and Precision-Recall Curves, and Confusion Matrices.
5. **Explainability**
    - Provided feature importance with XGBoost and used SHAP for interpretability of sample predictions.

## Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains code from data preprocessing to evaluation.
- **Documentation**: Overview of the model performance summary, metrics, visualizations, and explanations.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
